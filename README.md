# PropuestasPeru

**PropuestasPeru** is a blog platform where users can publish proposals on various topics, view others' proposals, like, and comment on them. Additionally, it includes a complete login system to securely manage user accounts and sessions.

## Key features of the project:
- **User Authentication:** Full login system allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions securely.
- **Proposals:** Users can create, view, and explore proposals on different topics.
- **Like & Comment:** Interaction system where users can like and comment on proposals shared by others.
- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile to manage their posts, likes, and comments.
- **Responsive Design:** The platform is designed to work seamlessly on different screen sizes and devices.

This project allowed me to apply my skills in web development, user authentication, and full-stack application architecture, creating a dynamic and interactive platform for sharing ideas.
